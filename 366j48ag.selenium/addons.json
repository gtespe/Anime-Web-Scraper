Easy on CPU and memory.","fullDescription":"An efficient blocker: easy on memory and CPU footprint, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there.\n\nIllustrated overview of its efficiency: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-vs.-ABP:-efficiency-compared\n\nUsage: The big power button in the popup is to permanently disable/enable uBlock for the current web site. It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @

autoplay for websites (Exceptions > Allow)\n• Allow session autoplay for websites (Exceptions > Allow for Session)\n       Stop only first autoplay for a continuous session in the website (useful for video sites like Dailymotion)\n• Proactive blocking for websites (Proactive blocking > Block)\n       Alternative stopping method that prevent script activation by tweaking the source code of the pages\n• Toolbarbutton to simplify allowing/blocking sites\n       Quick add-on enable/disable (Left-double-click)\n• Media autoplay blocking integration\n       Works with media.autoplay.enabled = false (for stopping isolated media elements)\n       The play/pause context menu item will show for covered video elements\n\nIf site still autoplay try enabling proactive blocking for the embedded site (remove blocking if it doesn't work).\nIf video functionality breaks on site add it to allowed sites (to prevent handling).\n\nShould work on:\n• YouTube - flash & html5\n• Facebook\n• Dailymotion\n• Msn | Bing\n• Yahoo - flash & html5 (with proactive blocking)\n• Aol | Huffington Post\n• BBC News\n• NBA.com - onsite player\n• NFL.com\n• alot of embeded players and live streaming (some with proactive blocking)\n\nKnown issues:\nIsolated media elements will not stop (use media.autoplay.enabled = false)\nWhen YouTube SPF is enabled (the thin red line) only the first video in the tab will not autoplay since new videos are loaded to the same player.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\nThis add-on is intended for stopping video autoplay, to achieve full flash blockability it can be complemented with an adblocker & a click-to-play flash blocker (preferably with a blacklist).\nThe add-on is highly dependent on websites autoplay implementation and is susceptible to changes made by the sites.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/121/121435.png?src=api&modified=1388443933","width":"641","height":"298","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/121/121435.png?src=api&modified=1388443933","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"93","caption":"YouTube"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/121/121436.png?src=api&modified=1388443933","width":"641","height":"466","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/121/121436.png?src=api&modified=1388443933","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"NBA.com"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/121/121437.png?src=api&modified=1388443933","width":"641","height":"364","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/121/121437.png?src=api&modified=1388443933","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"114","caption":"BBC
